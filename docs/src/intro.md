This is my own implication of rCore. 


## NOTE

Using EndeavourOS x86_64.
So there will be some change from the official tutorial.

for example `riscv64-elf-gdb` is provided by EndeavourOS, so it may not work on your pc.
And I will try to skip makefile. Instead, most used commands are in script.


## NOTE

python is also needed, 3.12+

## NOTE

location of `.cargo/` is important, make sure they are put at correct location
