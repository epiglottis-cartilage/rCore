# bootloader

I have tried to figure out how does bootloader work.
[rustsbi](https://github.com/rustsbi/rustsbi/blob/main/prototyper/README.md)

# use the newest

clone and compile the repo with `cargo prototyper --jump`. Then take the bin file. 
Here `rustsbi.bin` is a link to `rustsbi-prototyper-jump.bin` which is finally used by qemu.
